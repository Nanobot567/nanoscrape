## run nanoscrape

### easier version

check if you have python installed by running `python --version` in command prompt or terminal for windows or mac os, respectively. __make sure that the version number is above 3.4.x if it shows a version number.__ if not, go [here](https://python.org/download) and download the latest python version. 

download and extract nanoscrape-main.zip and run nanoscrape.bat. this batch file runs the command `python nanoscrape.py` and starts up nanoscrape by itself.

### more complicated version (not recommended)
first, you need to have python installed on your computer. go [here](https://python.org/download) to download python.

- to check if you already have python installed, open command prompt on windows or terminal on mac os or linux and type `python --version`. if you see a version number, you have python installed. __make sure that the version number is above 3.4.x.__

once you have python installed, open command prompt or terminal.

navigate to the directory that nanoscrape is located, after you have downloaded and extracted the .zip (usually located in (username)\downloads\ on windows, or (username)/downloads/ on mac os)

type this command and press enter:

`python nanoscrape.py`

if you do not see an error, you are good to go!
